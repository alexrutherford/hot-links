       "'The Senate has blocked the passage of a bill to reintroduce the Howard-era building industry watchdog, in a development overshadowed by the dispute over the future of the royal commission into trade unions.The bill failed on Monday because the Senate vote was tied at 33 in favour and 33 against. The government continued, however, to push ahead with a separate bill to toughen penalties for union officials who breach their duties.The Senate has previously blocked the latter bill, known as the registered organisation legislation, and if the upper house does so a second time it would create a trigger for a potential double-dissolution election.Senators debated the registered organisations bill on Monday evening and a vote was expected to occur some time on Tuesday.The government’s efforts to put the spotlight on union conduct – which it had wanted to use to apply pressure on the Labor party – have been undermined by the scrutiny of the former high court judge heading the royal commission, Dyson Heydon, over his initial willingness to speak at a Liberal party fundraiser.The release of correspondence surrounding the invitation dominated question time in both houses of parliament on Monday, and Heydon has foreshadowed a possible hearing on Friday to discuss union complaints about an alleged appearance of bias.The government won support from four crossbench senators – Bob Day, David Leyonhjelm, John Madigan and Nick Xenophon – to proceed to the next stage of debate on its bill to reinstate the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC).But three other crossbenchers – Jacqui Lambie, Glenn Lazarus and Ricky Muir – sided with Labor and the Greens to block the move, while the Palmer United party senator, Dio Wang, abstained. Because the supporters of the bill did not have a majority in the Senate, “the question was negatived”.The bill would have brought back building industry-specific provisions relating to unlawful action and coercion and restore higher penalties for contraventions. Unions have repeatedly argued the ABCC’s extraordinary powers were unfair on the basis they affected workers in one industry differently to those in other industries.The government’s Senate leader, Eric Abetz, said the Coalition would “re-engage with the crossbench” to seek support for the reintroduction of the ABCC bill.Abetz said no objective observer could deny there was “an endemic problem of industrial unlawfulness in this industry given the litany of court judgments and fines against the CFMEU for repeated and unrepentant breaches of the law”.“Labor and the Greens today voted against re-establishing the only regulator that had kept the CFMEU to account,” he said in a statement.“It is unfortunate that the Senate did not take the opportunity today to send a strong message to the construction industry that it has to comply with the law just like everyone else and that not all senators – especially those from South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia – chose to overlook the rampant unlawfulness in the construction industry their home states.”The CFMEU, which represents construction workers, argued the government was trying to discriminate against its members by subjecting them to harsher laws that did not apply to any other workers.The Greens MP Adam Bandt said the rejection of the ABCC bill was a win “for democracy and the rule of law”. “The Senate has made it clear that people won’t have fewer rights at work just because of the industry they work in,” he said.But the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, Innes Willox, said the rejection of the ABCC bill was disappointing because it contained “vital provisions to protect the community against unlawful conduct”.“The government should reintroduce the bill as soon as possible and redouble its efforts in engaging with the crossbench senators to secure their agreement to the passage of the bill,” he said.The Australian Mines and Metals Association, which is a resources industry employer group, said it was “beyond belief” that the Senate had voted against a more effective industrial watchdog for the construction industry.The association’s chief executive, Steve Knott, said the decision sent “a very bad signal that our parliament is not interested in cleaning up the unlawfulness and thuggery bringing down one of Australia’s most important industries”.Lambie said she had offered to support the reintroduction of the ABCC if the government agreed to give crossbench senators access to the confidential volume of Heydon’s interim report, which was completed in 2014.The independent Tasmanian senator also called on the government to deregister the CFMEU.Lambie accused the government of bringing on the registered organisations bill “as a political stunt” to give it the option of calling a double-dissolution election, even though it would be “political suicide” for Abbott to do so in the current climate. “They want it to fail,” she said of the workplace legislation.The latest Fairfax-Ipsos poll suggests Labor holds a lead over the Coalition of 54% to 46% based on preference flows at the last election.The government wants to increase civil penalties and introduce criminal offences for serious breaches of the duties of registered organisation officers, similar to those applicable under the Corporations Act.The Queensland Labor senator Joe Ludwig said registered organisations were not companies.

On Tuesday the AEC commissioner, Tom Rodgers, told a truncated inquiry into the voting overhaul the “three-month clock” would begin as soon as legislation was passed but “the AEC stands ready to deliver an election whenever the government call it with the legislation that’s in force at the time”. “If I get less time or resources, internally that’s not going to be a pretty look but we will deliver a successful election,” Rodgers told the joint select committee on electoral matters.\\nThe government, backed by the Greens and Nick Xenophon, is proposing to abolish group voting tickets and enshrine optional preferential voting “above the line”, where voters number their preferred parties. They will be “advised” by the AEC to number at least six boxes. Confirmation by Rodgers of the AEC’s three-month timeline means the new system could be implemented in time for a July double-dissolution election, should the changes pass before parliament rises on 17 March for the pre-budget break. Among the available triggers to dissolve both houses is a bill to reinstate the Australian Building and Construction Commission, rejected by the Senate in August last year but reintroduced to parliament this month. The voting changes are largely in line with the recommendations of a 2014 inquiry by the committee, except that they continue to require voters to number every box if they vote “below the line”. They are bitterly opposed by Labor and the crossbenchers, most of whom stand to be wiped out under the new system. Internal Labor modelling leaked to the West Australian indicates that it too would be disadvantaged by the changes, one report arguing that “over two election cycles, this scenario would see the Coalition win control of the Senate following the second election”. Senator Ricky Muir, whose ascension to the Senate on 0.5% of the primary vote was a major driver to change the system, said the committee examining the bill was “the most biased and unbalanced” he had ever seen. The committee, which is also hearing from psephologists Malcolm Mackerras and Antony Green, reports on Wednesday morning.\\n     --- \\n Document 2 \\n -----\\n That capitalism is unfair has been said before. But it is the way Thomas Piketty says it – subtly but with relentless logic – that has sent rightwing economics into a frenzy, both here and in the US.His book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, has shot to the top of the Amazon bestseller list. Carrying it under your arm has, in certain latitudes of Manhattan, become the newest tool for making a social connection among young progressives. Meanwhile, he is been condemned as neo-Marxist by rightwing commentators. So why the\\xa0fuss?Piketty\\'s argument is that, in an economy where the rate of return on capital outstrips the rate of growth, inherited wealth will always grow faster than earned wealth. So the fact that rich kids can swan aimlessly from gap year to internship to a job at father\\'s bank/ministry/TV network – while the poor kids sweat into their barista uniforms – is not an accident: it\\xa0is the system working normally.If you get slow growth alongside better financial returns, then inherited wealth will, on average, \"dominate wealth amassed from a lifetime\\'s labour by a wide margin\", says Piketty. Wealth will concentrate to levels incompatible with democracy, let alone social justice. Capitalism, in short, automatically creates levels of inequality that are unsustainable. The\\xa0rising wealth of the 1% is neither a\\xa0blip, nor rhetoric.To understand why the mainstream finds this proposition so annoying, you have to understand that \"distribution\" – the polite name for inequality – was thought to be a closed subject. Simon Kuznets, the Belarussian émigré who became a major figure in American economics, used the available data to show that, while societies become more unequal in the first stages of industrialisation, inequality subsides as they achieve maturity. This \"Kuznets Curve\" had been accepted by most parts of the economics profession until Piketty and his collaborators produced the evidence that it is false.In fact, the curve goes in exactly the opposite direction: capitalism started out unequal, flattened inequality for much of the 20th century, but is now headed back towards Dickensian levels of inequality worldwide.Piketty accepts that the fruits of economic maturity – skills, training and education of the workforce – do promote greater equality. But they can\\xa0be offset by a more fundamental tendency towards inequality, which is unleashed wherever demographics or low taxation or weak labour organisation allows it. Many of the book\\'s 700 pages are spent marshalling the evidence that 21st-century capitalism is on a one-way journey towards inequality – unless we do something.Thomas Piketty in his office in Paris. Photograph: Ed Alcock for the GuardianIf Piketty is right, there are big political implications, and the beauty of the book is that he never refrains from drawing them. Piketty\\'s call for a \"confiscatory\" global tax on inherited wealth makes other supposedly radical economists look positively house-trained. He calls for an 80% tax on incomes above $500,000 a year in the US, assuring his readers there would be neither a flight of top execs to Canada nor a slowdown in growth, since the outcome would simply be to suppress such incomes.While bestriding the macro-economic agenda, the book\\'s sideswipes against trendy micro-economics, often in footnotes, read like a sustained in-joke against the generation for whom all problems seemed solved, except the street price of cocaine in Georgetown.The book has, in addition, mesmerised the economics profession because of the way Piketty creates his own world, theoretically. He defines the two basic categories, wealth and income, broadly and confidently but in a way nobody had really bothered to before. The book\\'s terms and explanations are utterly simple; with a myriad of historical data, Piketty reduces the story of capitalism to a clear narrative arc. To challenge his\\xa0argument you have to reject the premises of it, not the working out.From page one he illustrates with visceral reminders of the unfair world we live in: he begins with the Marikana mining massacre and he never lets up. He marshals not just 18th-century interest rates as evidence but also the work of Jane Austen and Honoré de Balzac. He uses both authors to illustrate how, by\\xa0the early 19th century, it was logical to disdain work in favour of marrying into wealth. That it has become so again busts the central myth of, and moral justification for, capitalism: that\\xa0wealth is generated by effort, ingenuity, work, wise investment, risk\\xa0taking etc.For Piketty, the long, mid-20th century period of rising equality was a\\xa0blip, produced by\\xa0the exigencies of war, the power of organised labour, the need for high taxation, and by demographics and technical innovation.The Bank of England, standing in the heart of the City. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPut crudely, if growth is high and the returns on capital can be suppressed, you can have a more equal capitalism. But, says Piketty, a repeat of the Keynesian era\\xa0is\\xa0unlikely: labour is too weak, technological innovation too slow, the\\xa0global power of capital too great. In\\xa0addition, the legitimacy of this unequal\\xa0system is high: because it has\\xa0found ways to\\xa0spread the wealth down to the managerial class in a way the early 19th\\xa0century did not.If he is right, the implications for capitalism are utterly negative: we face a low-growth capitalism, combined with high levels of inequality and low levels of social mobility. If you are not born into wealth to start with, life, for even for the best educated, will be like Jane Eyre without Mr\\xa0Rochester.Is Piketty the new Karl Marx? Anybody who has read the latter will know he is not. Marx\\'s critique of capitalism was not about distribution but production: for Marx it was not rising inequality but a breakdown in the profit mechanism that drove the system towards its end. Where Marx saw social relationships – between labour and managers, factory owners and the landed aristocracy – Piketty sees only social categories: wealth and income. Marxist economics lives in a world where the inner tendencies of capitalism are belied by its surface experience. Piketty\\'s world is of concrete historical data only. So the charges of soft Marxism are completely misplaced.Piketty has, more accurately, placed an unexploded bomb within mainstream, classical economics. If the underlying cause of the 2008 bank catastrophe was falling incomes alongside rising financial wealth then, says Piketty, these were no accident: no product of lax regulation or simple greed. The crisis is the product of the system working normally, and we should expect more.One of the most compelling chapters is Piketty\\'s discussion of the near-universal rise of what he calls the \"social state\". The relentless growth in\\xa0the proportion of national income consumed by the state, spent on universal services, pensions and benefits, he argues, is an irreversible feature of modern capitalism. He notes that redistribution has become a question of \"rights to\" things – healthcare and pensions – rather than simply a problem of taxation rates. His solution is a\\xa0specific, progressive tax on private wealth: an exceptional tax on capital, possibly combined with the overt use\\xa0of inflation.The policy logic for the left is clear. For much of the 20th century, redistribution was handled through taxes on income. In the 21st century, any party that wants to redistribute would have to confiscate wealth, not just income.You would expect the Wall Street Journal to dissent, but the power of Piketty\\'s work is that it also challenges the narrative of the centre-left under globalisation, which believed upskilling the workforce, combined with mild redistribution, would promote social justice. This, Piketty demonstrates, is mistaken. All that social democracy and liberalism can produce, with their current policies, is the oligarch\\'s yacht co-existing with the food bank for ever.Piketty\\'s Capital, unlike Marx\\'s Capital, contains solutions possible on the terrain of capitalism itself: the 15% tax on capital, the 80% tax on high incomes, enforced transparency for all bank transactions, overt use of inflation to redistribute wealth downwards. He\\xa0calls some of them \"utopian\" and\\xa0he is right. It is easier to imagine capitalism collapsing than the elite consenting to them.Paul Mason is culture and digital editor\\xa0of Channel 4 News.
