      "Vladimir Putin, as President of Russia, has been personally targeted with specific sanctions by major Western powers in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Here’s a summary of the main sanctions against him as of mid-2022:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Personal Sanctions\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Travel Bans and Asset Freezes**: The US, European Union, UK, and other allied countries have imposed asset freezes and travel bans on Putin personally, making it illegal for people and businesses in those countries to provide him access to any assets or transact with him. This includes any known assets in these jurisdictions.\n",
      "- **Sanctions on Putin’s Inner Circle**: Sanctions have also targeted Putin’s family members (such as alleged relatives and close associates), as well as several oligarchs considered to be in his inner circle. These measures aim to disrupt his support network and cut off financial flows to people seen as beneficiaries or sustainers of his regime.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Economic and Symbolic Sanctions\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Wider Economic Measures**: While many sanctions are not aimed just at Putin personally but at the Russian economy, industry, and state enterprises, they are explicitly framed as measures to constrain Putin’s ability to fund and sustain the war in Ukraine. These include heavy restrictions on Russia’s banking sector, oil and gas exports, technology imports, and impeding Russia’s access to financial markets.\n",
      "- **Ban on Russian Gold and Precious Metals**: G7 and other Western states have banned the import of Russian-sourced gold—a key asset class for Russian elites and possibly for Putin himself.\n",
      "- **Exclusion from International Forums**: Putin is also subject to diplomatic isolation measures, such as exclusion from summits and major meetings involving Western leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Enforcement and Symbolism\n",
      "\n",
      "These actions are meant to have both practical impact (limiting access to wealth, travel, and global finance) and symbolic impact, marking Putin as a pariah on the world stage. However, the personal effectiveness of such sanctions is sometimes debated, given uncertainties about Putin’s actual overseas assets and his already restricted foreign travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Important Context\n",
      "\n",
      "- The measures against Putin and his circle are part of a much broader package of Western sanctions against Russia’s state apparatus and economy, all directed at undermining Putin’s ability to wage war in Ukraine.\n",
      "- There is ongoing debate about the effect of these sanctions on Putin personally, as opposed to broader impacts on the Russian economy and society. Some argue that while sanctions may inconvenience or symbolically shame top leaders, their direct deterrent effect is uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you would like a detailed breakdown of the sanctions as they appear in official documents or reports, or more examples of people in his inner circle who have been sanctioned, let me know!\n"

      "Breastfeeding has several positive effects for poor mothers, particularly regarding the development and future success of their children:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Better Cognitive Development for Children:** Studies show that children of poorer mothers who breastfeed do significantly better on tasks involving speaking, drawing, and comprehension. For example, breastfed children of disadvantaged mothers perform 8% better in cognitive ability tests up to age seven than those who are bottle-fed. At age three, these children score nearly 10 points higher in expressive language and around 8 points higher in school readiness than the average. These cognitive benefits persist at ages five and seven, including visuo-spatial skills and pictorial reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Preparation for School:** The improved cognitive skills gained from breastfeeding prepare children better for starting primary school, which can be especially valuable for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cost Savings:** For poor mothers, breastfeeding is cost-effective compared to formula feeding, which can pose a financial burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Health Benefits:** There is substantial evidence suggesting health benefits of breastfeeding for both mother and baby, though a specific study cited did not find health differences in the period examined for childhood (other sources may report reduced risks of infections, obesity, and chronic diseases).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Reduction of Inequities:** Since better-off women are more likely to breastfeed, increasing breastfeeding rates among poorer mothers could help reduce inequities in child development and educational outcomes.\n",
      "\n",

      "[Content(text='Vladimir Potanin, known as the “Nickel King” and Russia’s second richest person, has become the latest Russian oligarch to be subjected to sanctions by the UK as ministers target “Putin’s inner circle”. The government on Wednesday announced sanctions against Potanin, who was deputy prime minister under Boris Yelstin; Anna Tsivileva, a cousin of Putin and president of the prominent Russian coal mining company JSC Kolmar Group; and Said Gutseriev, son of the already blacklisted Russian billionaire Mikhail Gutseriev. “As long as Putin continues his abhorrent assault on Ukraine, we will use sanctions to weaken the Russian war machine,” a government spokesperson said. “Today’s sanctions show that nothing and no one is off the table, including Putin’s inner circle.” The Foreign Office said Potanin was added to the list of more than 1,000 Russians hit by sanctions because he “continues to amass wealth as he supports Putin’s regime, acquiring Rosbank, and shares in Tinkoff Bank in the period since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine”. Potanin was earlier this year named by Forbes magazine as Russia’s second-richest man with an estimated $17.3bn fortune, behind steel magnate Vladimir Lisin, who is reported to be worth $18.4bn. When Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February, Potanin was one of about three dozen oligarchs summoned to the Kremlin for an audience with the Russian president. He has also been photographed playing ice hockey with Putin.\\nPolicy experts have speculated that Potanin had so far avoided being sanctioned by the UK, US and EU because his Siberian nickel and palladium mining company Norilsk Nickel is crucial for the global automotive and semi conductor industry. Norilsk produces about 15% of the world’s high-grade nickel used in batteries, and about 40% of its palladium, which is crucial for the manufacture of semiconductors. Potanin this week ordered his $300m superyacht Nirvana to dock in Dubai, where oligarchs are sheltering their superyachts and other assets to avoid the risk of them being seized by western governments. The 88-metre superyacht, featuring a glass elevator, gym, hot tub, 3D cinema and two terrariums of exotic reptiles, was on Tuesday spotted docked in Dubai’s Port Rashid. Madame Gu, the $156m superyacht owned by sanctioned Russian billionaire parliamentarian Andrei Skoch, is moored nearby.\\nSaid Gutseriev was designated for sanctions for “obtaining a benefit from or supporting the government of Russia” in his role as a director of SFI, a Russian company formerly called Safmar Financial Investments in which his father was previously a “controlling shareholder”. His father, Mikhail, was designated previously for supporting the repressive regime of Belarus’s dictator, Alexander Lukashenko.\\nSaid Gutseriev is understood to live in London. The Guardian and reporting partners last month revealed a London property portfolio worth £160m linked to Said Gutseriev, and also published details of his shareholdings in SFI. A spokesperson for Gutseriev previously told the Guardian: “Mr Said Gutseriev is not a political figure and has no personal or financial links to the Russian or Belarusian governments.” The Foreign Office said Tsivileva, Putin’s first cousin once removed, and her husband, Sergey Tsivilev, “have significantly benefited from their relationship to Putin”. Tsivilev is governor of the coal-rich Kemerovo region of Siberia. Tsivileva’s company JSC Kolmar Group has also been hit with sanctions.', type='text')]\n",

If that assessment was intended to galvanise EU leaders at a crucial moment, it appears to have just about done its job. The partial embargo on Russian oil imports agreed at the summit on Monday night constitutes a significant, if belated, ratcheting up of economic pressure on Vladimir Putin’s regime. After a month of negotiations between member states, objections from Hungary were finally overcome through a temporary exemption for oil transported through a Soviet-era pipeline to central Europe. Given that Germany and Poland will forgo imports from this source, by the end of the year the embargo should cover over 90% of Russian oil supplies to Europe. The effect of the ban over time, and combined with other sanctions, will be to deprive Moscow of funds and means to prosecute a prolonged war of attrition that it did not anticipate having to fight. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, was therefore justified in describing the oil embargo as a show of unity and a “landmark” agreement. An announcement of €9bn in economic aid to Ukraine was also welcome, although it should only be seen as a start. The Kyiv School of Economics has calculated that the war is causing about $4.5bn worth of damage to civilian infrastructure every week. The costs of postwar reconstruction could run into hundreds of billions of dollars. However, financing that colossal challenge is tomorrow’s task. In the shorter term – as it attempts to intensify the financial squeeze on Mr Putin – the west must give Ukraine the military assistance it needs to resist Russian forces, while continuing to avoid moves that risk escalating and widening the war. In May, Washington committed to a $40bn package to aid Ukraine’s war effort, and the supply of US weapons is accelerating – including vital artillery capability. European countries need to up the pace of their own contributions, as the Kremlin attempts to concentrate overwhelming force in the east and annexe new territory. But the US president, Joe Biden, was right this week to rule out sending long-range missile systems to Ukraine which could be deployed to hit targets inside Russia. Moscow’s nuclear capability – and the threatening rhetoric intermittently deployed in relation to it – must necessarily inform the west’s strategic calculations, however enraging that may be. The goal, as Mr Putin’s appalling war of choice continues, must be that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people are enabled to negotiate its end from a position of strength and dignity. If this is to be achieved, it will be through a combination of economic pressure on Moscow and military resistance. Russia’s armed forces are being steadily and damagingly depleted, even as incremental territorial gains are made. Around 1,000 tanks may have been lost on the battlefield, while two of Russia’s tank manufacturers have reportedly ceased production due to a lack of parts. Thus far, Mr Putin has shown total disregard for the human cost of his invasion, now measured in tens of thousands of lost lives. But the cumulative impact of sanctions can set logistical limits to his brutal revanchist ambitions. This week’s oil embargo is an important step in that direction.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='A proposed cap on the price of Russian oil and pipeline gas to slash the Kremlin’s revenues and reduce inflationary pressures in the west gathered support on Sunday as G7 leaders met in Bavaria. The three-day event will be dominated by discussion of how to tighten the economic and military vice around Vladimir Putin without leading to disastrous spillovers, including a backlash among western consumers and starvation in a rain and grain-starved global south. Joe Biden, at the outset of the summit held in the Bavarian alpine castle that formed the venue for the 2015 G7 meeting, said Putin had been thwarted by the degree of unity shown by the west. “Putin has been counting on it from the beginning that somehow Nato and the G7 would splinter. But we haven’t and we’re not going to,” Biden said.\\nBut behind the scenes, as Putin rained missiles on Kyiv and made further territorial gains in the east of Ukraine, there is deep concern that the west has not yet assembled the policy mix that will force him to back down. A plan to ban imports of Russian gold trailed by the US and the UK, regarded as an incremental not decisive step, does not yet have the clear support of the EU. Twin caps on the price of Russian oil and pipeline gas are being canvassed heavily by the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, and at Sunday’s opening meeting he gained the support of the French president, Emmanuel Macron. “There is now more than mild optimism that this will work,” one source said. The gas cap would operate simply by European countries refusing to pay above an as-yet unspecified fixed price for Russian gas. It is argued Russia in the short term has no alternative market to sell the pipeline gas, and unless it was prepared to take a huge hit to its revenues by shutting down the pipeline altogether would have no option but to sell at the price dictated by Europe. Liquid gas would be exempted from this maximum price. “Putting a ceiling on the price of fossil fuels imported from Russia has a geopolitical goal as well as an economic and social one,” Draghi told the G7. “We need to reduce our funding to Russia. And we need to eliminate one of the main causes of inflation. We must avoid the mistakes made after the 2008 crisis: the energy crisis must not produce a return of populism. “We must mitigate the impact of rising energy prices, compensate families and businesses in difficulty, and tax companies that make extraordinary profits.” A price cap would operate by dictating to the quasi-monopoly responsible for insuring Russian oil tankers that they will be sanctioned if they allow oil to be sold above a fixed price. About 95% of the world’s tanker liability coverage is arranged through a City of London-based insurance organisation called the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs, which has to heed European law. The proposal has been promoted most heavily by the US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, and may have to be squared with Opec, the oil producers club. Russian oil production has fallen under the pressure of sanctions, but its per barrel revenues are up due to the high price of oil globally, the polar opposite of what western leaders want. The US and Canada have banned imports of Russian oil while the European Union has agreed to prohibit seaborne imports of Russian crude by the end of the year. Germany is probably the single G7 country most queasy about price caps. It fears a bust-up inside the EU over the proposal and that Putin may simply turn off the supplies of gas to Europe. Last week Russia cut gas flows by 60%, citing delays in maintenance equipment, but the explanation was not regarded as credible within the G7. A cut off now would leave Europe struggling to build up the gas reserves it needs to survive what could be a fraught winter.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='EU leaders suggested Russian gas was unlikely to be part of the next round of sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s war machine, hours after agreeing a historic but incomplete oil embargo. After nearly a month of wrangling, the EU agreed to ban 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of the year, with an exemption for Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. These landlocked central European countries, heavily dependent on Russian oil, can continue being supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for an indeterminate period. Following the oil embargo, a measure that would have been unthinkable six months ago, Baltic leaders called for talks on further sanctions. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said the EU needed to start discussing its next sanctions against Russia because things were “not going any better” in Ukraine. “As long as the war is going on, there is no peace, Ukraine hasn’t won the war; we haven’t done enough.” The Estonian PM, like her counterparts in the Baltic states and Poland, wants the EU to phase out Russian gas quickly. But Kallas said she was “realistic” and did not expect to see gas in the next set of sanctions. “Gas is of course much more difficult than oil already was,” she told reporters on the second day of an EU summit. “All the next sanctions will be more difficult, because so far they have only hurt Russians, but now they are also having effects on Europeans and that is why it is also much more politically difficult to decide.” Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said gas could not be part of the EU’s next set of sanctions. “Russian oil is much easier to compensate [for] … gas is completely different, which is why a gas embargo will not be an issue in the next sanctions package,” he said. The oil embargo was agreed at a special EU summit on Monday, after Hungary gained a guarantee that it could get access to seaborne oil, if Russian supplies via the Druzhba pipeline, which passes through war-torn Ukraine, were cut off. In a message on Facebook, Hungary’s PM, Viktor Orbán, said he had secured an exemption from the oil embargo that he likened to an “atomic bomb” hitting the Hungarian economy. “Families can sleep peacefully tonight, we kept out the most hair-raising idea,” Orbán said. EU leaders played down the row with Hungary, currently embroiled in a long-running stand-off with Brussels over the rule of law and its access to EU cash. “The important thing is that we are all together, we are united,” said Latvia’s prime minister, Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš. The Ukrainian foreign minister on Tuesday welcomed the partial block on Russian oil imports. “The oil embargo will speed up the countdown to the collapse of the Russian economy and war machine,” Dmytro Kuleba said in a statement, estimating the ban could cost Russia tens of billions of dollars. He praised the EU for “not only making it harder for the Kremlin to finance the aggression but also shoring up its own energy security”, though a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had earlier given a withering assessment of EU support for his country. “Russia must not win, but we won’t give heavy weapons – it may offend [Russia]. Putin must lose, but let’s not impose new sanctions. Millions will starve, but we’re not ready for military convoys with grain. Rising prices are not the worst that awaits a democratic world with such a policy,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter. Zelenskiy addressed EU leaders by video link on Monday, urging them to unite because disputes “only encourage Russia to put more pressure on you”.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='Russia has further cut off gas supplies to Europe, after state energy giant Gazprom turned off the taps to a top Dutch trader and halted flows to some companies in Denmark and Germany. The intensification of the economic battle on Tuesday over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine follows the EU’s overnight decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports as part of its financial sanctions against the Kremlin.\\nEU leaders said the ban would immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports, rising to 90% by the end of the year. Gazprom extended its gas cuts on Tuesday by stopping supply to GasTerra, which buys and trades gas on behalf of the Dutch government. It later said it would also cut off gas flows to the Danish energy firm Ørsted and to Shell Energy for its contract to supply gas to Germany, after both companies failed to make payments in roubles. GasTerra said it had found contracts elsewhere for the supply of the 2bn cubic metres of gas it had been expecting to receive from Gazprom between now and October. Ahead of the late-night talks in Brussels, Denmark had signalled it expected its Russian gas supply to end. However, Ørsted said on Monday that a gas cut would not immediately put the country’s gas supplies at risk. Moscow has already halted supplies of natural gas to Bulgaria, Poland and Finland, after they refused to pay in Russian roubles. Gazprom said it had been told by Shell Energy Europe Limited that it would not pay in roubles for gas supplied to Germany. It added that the contract stipulated gas supplies of up to 1.2bn cubic metres per year. Gazprom said Shell and Ørsted had failed to pay for gas deliveries by the end of the working day on May 31, and would stop deliveries until they paid in line with Russian demands. The Kremlin had demanded payments for exports in roubles earlier in the spring, after the country’s currency fell off a cliff after the invasion of Ukraine and Russia was excluded from the Swift international bank messaging system in earlier rounds of sanctions. The EU’s energy commissioner had previously said that member states would have to reject Moscow’s demands, as the mechanism set out by Russia would have breached the bloc’s sanctions, even if this left them without alternative gas supply.\\nSupply cuts have pushed already high gas prices even higher, contributing to soaring inflation, and also putting pressure on European governments and companies to find alternative supplies and infrastructure, including storage facilities. The EU has faced criticism over the past weeks for not going far enough in its sanctions against Russia. Ahead of Monday’s summit in Brussels, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed to EU leaders to show unity against Vladimir Putin. Under a compromise plan from the summit, Russian oil transported through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for use by Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia would be exempt from the EU embargo. Despite this agreement, Estonia’s prime minister has called on the EU to go further and work on a seventh round of sanctions against Russia, which would include restrictions on gas imports. However, Kaja Kallas said she was not confident this would happen. “I think that gas has to be in the seventh package but I am realistic as well,” Kallas told reporters as she arrived for a second day of talks in Brussels. “I don’t think it will be there.”', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='Russia will deliver missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to Belarus in the coming months, President Vladimir Putin has said as he received Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. “In the coming months, we will transfer to Belarus Iskander-M tactical missile systems, which can use ballistic or cruise missiles, in their conventional and nuclear versions,” Putin said in a broadcast on Russian television at the start of his meeting with Lukashenko in St Petersburg on Saturday. Putin has several times referred to nuclear weapons since his country launched a military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, in what the west has seen as a warning not to intervene. Lukashenko said last month that his country had bought Iskander nuclear-capable missiles and S-400 anti-aircraft anti-missile systems from Russia.\\nThe development came on the eve of a meeting of G7 leaders in Germany on Sunday, to be hosted by Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the Bavarian alps, which is set to be dominated by Ukraine and its far-reaching consequences, from energy shortages to a food crisis. The G7 leaders are expected to seek to show a united front on supporting Ukraine for as long as necessary and cranking up pressure on the Kremlin – although they will want to avoid sanctions that could stoke inflation and exacerbate the global cost-of-living crisis. “The main message from the G7 will be unity and coordination of action … That’s the main message, that even through difficult times … we stick to our alliance,” an EU official said. The G7 partners are set to agree to ban imports of gold from Russia, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. A German government source later said that leaders were having “really constructive” conversations on a possible price cap on Russian oil imports. This year, Scholz invited as partner countries Senegal, the current chair of the African Union, Argentina, which heads the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, Indonesia and India, the present and next hosts of the G20 group of large industrial nations, and South Africa. “The summit must send not only the message that Nato and the G7 are more united than ever, but also that the democracies of the world stand together against Putin’s imperialism just as they do in the fight against hunger and poverty,” Scholz told the German parliament this week.\\nPutin also offered to upgrade Belarus’ warplanes to make them capable of carrying nuclear weapons, amid soaring tensions with the west over Ukraine. “Many Su-25 [aircraft] are in service with the Belarusian military. They could be upgraded in an appropriate way,” the Russian leader said. “This modernisation should be carried out in aircraft factories in Russia and the training of personnel should start in accordance with this,” he added, after Lukashenko asked him to “adapt” the planes.\\n“We will agree on how to accomplish this,” Putin said. During the meeting Lukashenko expressed concern about the “aggressive”, “confrontational” and “repulsive” policies of its neighbours Lithuania and Poland and asked Putin to help Belarus mount a “symmetrical response” to what he said were nuclear-armed flights by Nato near Belarus’ borders. Putin said he saw no need at present for a symmetrical response. The Iskander-M, a mobile guided missile system codenamed “SS-26 Stone” by Nato, replaced the Soviet Scud missile. Its two guided missiles have a range of up to 500km (300 miles) and can carry conventional or nuclear warheads. In the past week, Lithuania in particular has infuriated Russia by blocking the transit of goods subject to European sanctions travelling across its territory from Russia, through Belarus, to Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='“United against megalomania” was how one German newspaper succinctly put it. Sanctions on Russian gold exports, the enlargement of the Nato intervention force to six times its current strength, an air missile defence system for Ukraine, and a broad commitment that the Group of Seven will be with Ukraine for as long as it takes. None of these, secured at this week’s G7 summit held high in the Bavarian Alps in weather that ranged from glorious sunshine to shattering thunderstorms, is a paltry achievement. But there was one idea that stood out, both because it is new, divided the G7 and told a bigger story about the dilemma the west faces as it tries to damage Vladimir Putin’s war economy. It is the proposal of a global price cap on energy. The idea has a simple attraction as it deals with two problems. It would bring energy prices back under some form of control, quelling a consumer backlash about inflation. At the same time, it would slow the flow of western funds to Putin’s war machine, which is largely dependent on gas and oil revenues supplied by western purchases. Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, explained at one briefing that the west was facing a dilemma. It had through its own measures cut the amount of Russian energy it was purchasing, but due to the rise in the price of oil, the revenues reaching Putin had not correspondingly declined. Russia is, according to business intelligence company Rystad Energy, due to secure at least $180bn (£147m). That is 45% higher than in 2021 and 181% higher than in 2020. The solution is at one level disarmingly simple – to refuse to pay as much as Putin and the market demand. Such an idea, so antithetical to free-market principles, might seem like a Marxist magic bullet but it comes with the backing of Mario Draghi, the former president of the European Central Bank, and Janet Yellen, the head of the US Treasury. And it is the brainchild of Washington academics. Advocates are, however, touting slightly different but not necessarily conflicting versions of the idea. Yellen principally wants to impose a cap on the price of seaborne oil, which will disproportionately affect Russia. Draghi thinks it is possible to go further by putting a cap on piped Russian gas. In some ways, his idea has greater potential since European consumption is not due to trail off as quickly. Francesco Giavazzi, the economic adviser to the Italian prime minister, explained Draghi’s plan to the Guardian. He said: “Russia’s gas pipelines essentially go in two directions: to Europe and – for the moment with much smaller capacity – to China. A gas producer can slow the flow of gas, but it cannot stop it. Ultimately, if there is no flow, one will have to start burning gas in the air – which means burning dollars in the air. Putin could do it, but it would be very expensive for Russia, also politically.” Draghi, who tends to get a hearing at summits on economic issues, explained: “We must reduce the amount of money going to Russia and get rid of one of the main causes of inflation.” The oil cap would in theory work through one lever – insurance. Nearly 95% of the world’s oil tanker fleet is covered by the International Group of Protection & Indemnity Clubs in the heart of the City of London, and some firms based in continental Europe. European nations already agreed to end insurance for Russian oil shipments. Western governments could try to impose a price cap by telling buyers their insurance is available, but only as long as they agree not to pay more than a certain price for the oil onboard.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='A price cap on Russian oil, deferral of climate change commitments, a potential famine in Africa and the further supply of weapons to Ukraine are to crowd into a meeting of G7 world leaders over the next three days held against the backdrop of the biggest geopolitical crisis since 1945. The agenda reveals how the world has been turned upside down since leaders of the industrialised states last met in Cornwall a year ago in a summit chaired by Britain, largely to focus on the threat posed by China. Before the summit in Germany, Boris Johnson issued a warning for the west not to show war fatigue, a point that will be echoed when the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addresses the meeting by video link. He is expected to emphasise the difficulties his troops are facing in eastern Ukraine as well as the need for heavier long-range weapons. Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskiy’s office, said the G7 should respond to the latest air strikes on Kyiv, which killed one person on Sunday, with a full gas embargo. The overall message from the three-day G7 meeting will be that sanctions are slowly working in degrading the Russian war machine, and will be stepped up if damage to the wider world economy can be contained. The US president, Joe Biden, urged the G7 to show resolve as he greeted the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. “We have to stay together, because Putin has been counting on from the beginning that somehow Nato and the G7 would splinter. But we haven’t and we’re not going to.” A ban on new imports of Russian gold will be one new measure of solidarity with Ukraine, but the idea of a cap on Russian oil prices, backed by Biden, has forced its way into the discussions as a visible means of slowing rampant inflation, one of the chief topics of conversation when the G7 leaders gathered for their first session over three days in the Bavarian Alps. Such a price mechanism would set an upper limit on imports of oil from Russia, which would be imposed unilaterally by each participating country and prevent Russia selling at a higher price. For European nations, it is also seen as a way potentially to dampen rampant inflation driven by energy prices. Some European countries have been wary that it could potentially require the painful reopening of the existing European Union agreement on oil sanctions against Russia. That would need the agreement of all 27 EU member states. The EU is due to phase out its dependence on Russian oil by the end of the year, with some exemptions, but that deal required laborious discussion. It is also unclear how key buyers of Russian crude, such as China and India, could be coaxed into complying with a price cap. One idea being floated by the US would be to make their access to shipping insurance for oil cargo dependent on not paying more than the agreed fixed cap for the oil onboard. The EU has agreed to ban insurance for the transportation of crude and petroleum products from Russia. Italy has for weeks been pressing to go further by introducing a cap on gas prices, an idea backed by Italian energy firms. French officials at the summit expressed a willingness to discuss an oil price cap, but suggested Europe needed a broader energy price shield to bring inflation under control. However, there is no guarantee that Vladimir Putin would not respond by cutting gas supplies further. Gazprom cut gas supplies by 60% last week, citing maintenance problems caused by the lack of supply of parts from Canada, an explanation that G7 leaders do not regard as credible. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline is due to shut down altogether for regular two-week summer maintenance in July and there are fears Putin would be prepared to take the hit to Russian and Gazprom revenues if he believed it would cause an industrial meltdown across Europe.', type='text')]\n",

He predicted that Russia would be forced to lower the price of its oil. “We are the most important client for Russia. They will have to look for another one and certainly they will have to decrease the price.” Some economists have suggested, however, that Russia could gain in the short-term rising prices caused by the oil embargo. At the start of the war, the EU was paying Russia around €1bn a day for energy imports. The bloc has now agreed to phase out coal by mid-August, and most oil by the end of the year, but has not set a date for gas.

Known in Brussels as RepowerEU, that plan calls for an extra €210bn (£178bn) over the next five years to pay for ending Russian fossil fuels and speeding up the switch to renewable power. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, told reporters that Russian fossil fuels had been “clearly addressed” by a coming ban on coal, oil and the RepowerEU plan. “The big bulk on energy this is up and running,” she said.

      "[Content(text='Vladimir Putin has issued fresh warnings that Russia would respond in kind if Nato set up military infrastructure in Finland and Sweden after they joined the US-led alliance. Putin was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying he could not rule out that tensions would emerge in Moscow’s relations with Helsinki and Stockholm over their joining Nato. “We don’t have problems with Sweden and Finland like we do with Ukraine,” the Russian president told a news conference in the Turkmenistan capital of Ashgabat. “We don’t have territorial differences.” “If Finland and Sweden wish to, they can join. That’s up to them. They can join whatever they want.” However, he warned “if military contingents and military infrastructure were deployed there, we would be obliged to respond symmetrically and raise the same threats for those territories where threats have arisen for us”. Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the “serious military and political consequences” of such a move would oblige it to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic Sea region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Russian officials earlier reacted angrily to Nato’s offer of membership to Finland and Sweden, calling it a “destabilising” effort that will increase tensions in the region. “We condemn the irresponsible course of the North Atlantic Alliance that is ruining the European architecture, or what’s left of it,” Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters on Wednesday. “I have a great deal of doubt as to whether the upcoming period will be calm for our north European neighbours,” he added.\\nThe decision followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has prompted Russian neighbours to appeal to Nato for additional security guarantees. Some have said that Russia will target countries in eastern and northern Europe that have condemned the war and joined international aid and sanctions efforts. A communique published at a Nato summit in Madrid said that the “accession of Finland and Sweden will make them (the allies) safer, Nato stronger and the Euro-Atlantic area more secure”.\\nBut in Russia, the news was met coolly. Konstantin Kosachev, a member of Russia’s Federation Council, said that the accession of Finland and Sweden into Nato would “certainly mean a worsening of relations between these two countries and Russia”. He noted that Finland and Russia share a long land border, while Russia and Sweden have shared interests in the Baltic and Barents Sea areas.\\n“All of this would definitely change for the worse, and definitely not at Russia’s initiative,” he said. “This can only be regretted.” The accession of the two countries into Nato would mean the end of a decades-long status quo that saw Finland, in particular, maintain a degree of neutrality during the cold war in order to avoid a direct confrontation with the Soviet Union.\\nIn the week before the decision, Russia’s foreign ministry announced that it would cut ties with a Finnish NGO and banned two Swedish organisations, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and the Swedish Institute. In a statement, the ministry accused the organisations of “focusing on efforts to destabilise Russian society”. Tensions have risen between Russia and countries in the Baltic region, which are members of Nato, raising concerns of a direct clash between Moscow and members of the security alliance.\\nVladimir Dzhabarov, another senior lawmaker, told a Russian radio station on Wednesday that a blockade of Russia’s Kaliningrad region could lead to an “armed conflict” with Lithuania. “If we feel that this security is being violated and it threatens us with the loss of our territory, of course, we will take extreme measures and nothing will stop us,” he said.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='The stigma attached to the trade means some international companies involved in fuel supplies may attempt to mask its origins. Some energy firms rushed to cut shipments from Russia but industry watchers said some drivers in the south-east of England were still likely to still be filling up with diesel refined in Russia. State processors of oil are attempting to secure six-month supply contacts for Russian crude to India, Bloomberg reported this month. The trio of state refiners – Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum – declined to answer questions on whether they were importing Russian oil or exporting it to Europe. Industry sources said tracking shipments of Russian oil to Europe via India is proving very difficult. “You’ll find that several shipments of crude will arrive at a port from different countries and be blended together. Tracking a hydrocarbon is basically impossible.” There are several tactics shippers are using to hide the origin of Russian oil, sources said. Financially, paying in Chinese currency – rather than the industry standard dollar – is an option. Yuan-rouble trading volumes have surged 1,067% since February’s invasion of Ukraine. Transfers of oil cargoes from ship-to-ship have also spiked, suggesting oil is being switched from Russian flagged-vessels to other ships. Increasing numbers of vessels have been “going dark” by switching off their automative identification systems as thousands of gallons of the black stuff are transferred on the waves. A third, more niche option to hide Russian transactions is to cut out using a currency and trade oil directly for other products, such as gold, food or weapons. Iran has previously taken payment from trading partners in gold rather than dollars. “If a country or oil operator wants to hide the source of crude or oil products, it can very easily do so,” said Ajay Parmar, an oil market analyst at ICIS.\\n“Indian refiners are clearly taking significant volumes of discounted Russian crude and then re-exporting a material proportion of refined product back out of the country,” said the Shore Capital analyst Craig Howie. “Given the obvious strength of petrol and diesel prices, this presumably supports robust refining margins for Indian downstream players. The commercial rationale here is of course understandable, but does seem to run contrary to the west’s clear objective to hamper the Russian economy and war machine.” Oleg Ustenko, the chief economic adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is more forthright. He told the Guardian: “We call on countries everywhere to show solidarity with Ukraine by rejecting Russia’s blood oil. But let’s be clear, the British and EU energy, shipping and insurance companies who are helping Putin complete this pivot to new markets out of pure greed are complicit in his war crimes. “European leaders must get serious about their sanctions regimes and ban not just the import of Russian fossil fuels, but also heavily tax their trade, otherwise the tragedy ongoing in Ukraine will continue and even spread.” For the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, the trade with Russia remains a political balancing act. While the oil price remains high, and there’s pressure on consumers at the pump, the risk of a western backlash will be weighed against the cost of cheap oil. Trafigura said it “unconditionally condemns” the war and has “substantially reduced its purchases of Russian crude” . The company said it ceased all trading with Russian organisations prior to EU sanctions introduced last month. Trafigura said it does not have “operational control” of Nayara Energy or Vadinar. Reliance declined to comment. • This article was amended on 29 June 2022 to include, for comparative purposes, figures for Europe’s public imports of Russian oil.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='A price cap on Russian oil, deferral of climate change commitments, a potential famine in Africa and the further supply of weapons to Ukraine are to crowd into a meeting of G7 world leaders over the next three days held against the backdrop of the biggest geopolitical crisis since 1945. The agenda reveals how the world has been turned upside down since leaders of the industrialised states last met in Cornwall a year ago in a summit chaired by Britain, largely to focus on the threat posed by China. Before the summit in Germany, Boris Johnson issued a warning for the west not to show war fatigue, a point that will be echoed when the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addresses the meeting by video link. He is expected to emphasise the difficulties his troops are facing in eastern Ukraine as well as the need for heavier long-range weapons. Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskiy’s office, said the G7 should respond to the latest air strikes on Kyiv, which killed one person on Sunday, with a full gas embargo. The overall message from the three-day G7 meeting will be that sanctions are slowly working in degrading the Russian war machine, and will be stepped up if damage to the wider world economy can be contained. The US president, Joe Biden, urged the G7 to show resolve as he greeted the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. “We have to stay together, because Putin has been counting on from the beginning that somehow Nato and the G7 would splinter. But we haven’t and we’re not going to.” A ban on new imports of Russian gold will be one new measure of solidarity with Ukraine, but the idea of a cap on Russian oil prices, backed by Biden, has forced its way into the discussions as a visible means of slowing rampant inflation, one of the chief topics of conversation when the G7 leaders gathered for their first session over three days in the Bavarian Alps. Such a price mechanism would set an upper limit on imports of oil from Russia, which would be imposed unilaterally by each participating country and prevent Russia selling at a higher price. For European nations, it is also seen as a way potentially to dampen rampant inflation driven by energy prices. Some European countries have been wary that it could potentially require the painful reopening of the existing European Union agreement on oil sanctions against Russia. That would need the agreement of all 27 EU member states. The EU is due to phase out its dependence on Russian oil by the end of the year, with some exemptions, but that deal required laborious discussion. It is also unclear how key buyers of Russian crude, such as China and India, could be coaxed into complying with a price cap. One idea being floated by the US would be to make their access to shipping insurance for oil cargo dependent on not paying more than the agreed fixed cap for the oil onboard. The EU has agreed to ban insurance for the transportation of crude and petroleum products from Russia. Italy has for weeks been pressing to go further by introducing a cap on gas prices, an idea backed by Italian energy firms. French officials at the summit expressed a willingness to discuss an oil price cap, but suggested Europe needed a broader energy price shield to bring inflation under control. However, there is no guarantee that Vladimir Putin would not respond by cutting gas supplies further. Gazprom cut gas supplies by 60% last week, citing maintenance problems caused by the lack of supply of parts from Canada, an explanation that G7 leaders do not regard as credible. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline is due to shut down altogether for regular two-week summer maintenance in July and there are fears Putin would be prepared to take the hit to Russian and Gazprom revenues if he believed it would cause an industrial meltdown across Europe.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='Russia has transformed an existing life-threatening wave of food crises into a tsunami by blocking the export of 25m tonnes of grain from Ukraine’s ports, the Germany’s foreign minister has said. Speaking at the start of an inter-ministerial food conference in Berlin, a precursor to the G7 meeting in Germany starting this weekend where aid groups will demand a big financial commitment to help Africa, Annalena Baerbock said 345 million people worldwide were currently threatened by food shortages. She said the hunger crisis was building “like a life-threatening wave before us” but it was Russia’s war that had “made a tsunami out of this wave”, and she said Russia was using hunger as a weapon of war. In an international blame game playing out across Africa, Russia claims it is western sanctions that are slowing the flow of Russian food.\\nAs many as 25 African countries, including many of the least developed, import more than one-third of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia, and 15 of them more than half. Her remarks led Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president and prime minister, to make a reference to the German starvation tactics in the second world war. He said: “German officials are accusing Russia of using hunger like a weapon. It is amazing to hear this from officials whose country kept Leningrad in blockade for 900 days, where almost 700 thousand people died of starvation.” But Baerbock’s criticism of Russia was backed by Arif Husain, the chief economist at the UN World Food Programme, who said it was not sanctions that were causing the food crisis but war. “We tend to address the symptoms and forget the root cause, and the root cause is war,” he said. He said more than 40 countries were now facing food inflation of over 15%, and upwards of 30 economies had seen depreciation of their currency of more than 25%. “The numbers do not lie. Pre-Covid we were looking at about 135 million people in crisis or the worst type of food security situation. Today, including Ukraine’s impact, that number is 345 million. There are about 50 million people in the world who are what we call in hunger emergencies, meaning one step away from famine. That is not in one, two or five countries, but upwards of 45 countries. That’s the magnitude, that’s the scale of the problem you’re talking about.” He also said the “affordability crisis” caused by high prices could turn into an “availability crisis” next year largely because fertilisers are not moving at the rates required. He said funding shortfalls caused by rising costs and demand meant the WFP was “having to cut rations left right and centre”. Speaking at a Chatham House conference, he rejected suggestions that the loss of Ukraine exports by sea could be substituted by road and rail. He said UN estimates showed only 1.5m to 2m tonnes of grain a month could be transported by road and rail routes, compared with the 5m to 6m a month normally exported through Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. He said the road routes would require 9,000 trucks a day.\\n“Think about the dynamic of 9,000 trucks on the road in a war zone. It would be prohibitively expensive by road even if you could do it. The premium for the grain would put you out of the market on the global stage. It is not about getting 1-2m tonnes out – that will not make a dent on world market prices.” The talks between Russia, the UN, Turkey and Ukraine centre on the terms for safe passage of grain convoys out of Odesa, as well as Russian claims that western sanctions are restricting its shipment of fertilisers.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='A proposed cap on the price of Russian oil and pipeline gas to slash the Kremlin’s revenues and reduce inflationary pressures in the west gathered support on Sunday as G7 leaders met in Bavaria. The three-day event will be dominated by discussion of how to tighten the economic and military vice around Vladimir Putin without leading to disastrous spillovers, including a backlash among western consumers and starvation in a rain and grain-starved global south. Joe Biden, at the outset of the summit held in the Bavarian alpine castle that formed the venue for the 2015 G7 meeting, said Putin had been thwarted by the degree of unity shown by the west. “Putin has been counting on it from the beginning that somehow Nato and the G7 would splinter. But we haven’t and we’re not going to,” Biden said.\\nBut behind the scenes, as Putin rained missiles on Kyiv and made further territorial gains in the east of Ukraine, there is deep concern that the west has not yet assembled the policy mix that will force him to back down. A plan to ban imports of Russian gold trailed by the US and the UK, regarded as an incremental not decisive step, does not yet have the clear support of the EU. Twin caps on the price of Russian oil and pipeline gas are being canvassed heavily by the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, and at Sunday’s opening meeting he gained the support of the French president, Emmanuel Macron. “There is now more than mild optimism that this will work,” one source said. The gas cap would operate simply by European countries refusing to pay above an as-yet unspecified fixed price for Russian gas. It is argued Russia in the short term has no alternative market to sell the pipeline gas, and unless it was prepared to take a huge hit to its revenues by shutting down the pipeline altogether would have no option but to sell at the price dictated by Europe. Liquid gas would be exempted from this maximum price. “Putting a ceiling on the price of fossil fuels imported from Russia has a geopolitical goal as well as an economic and social one,” Draghi told the G7. “We need to reduce our funding to Russia. And we need to eliminate one of the main causes of inflation. We must avoid the mistakes made after the 2008 crisis: the energy crisis must not produce a return of populism. “We must mitigate the impact of rising energy prices, compensate families and businesses in difficulty, and tax companies that make extraordinary profits.” A price cap would operate by dictating to the quasi-monopoly responsible for insuring Russian oil tankers that they will be sanctioned if they allow oil to be sold above a fixed price. About 95% of the world’s tanker liability coverage is arranged through a City of London-based insurance organisation called the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs, which has to heed European law. The proposal has been promoted most heavily by the US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, and may have to be squared with Opec, the oil producers club. Russian oil production has fallen under the pressure of sanctions, but its per barrel revenues are up due to the high price of oil globally, the polar opposite of what western leaders want. The US and Canada have banned imports of Russian oil while the European Union has agreed to prohibit seaborne imports of Russian crude by the end of the year. Germany is probably the single G7 country most queasy about price caps. It fears a bust-up inside the EU over the proposal and that Putin may simply turn off the supplies of gas to Europe. Last week Russia cut gas flows by 60%, citing delays in maintenance equipment, but the explanation was not regarded as credible within the G7. A cut off now would leave Europe struggling to build up the gas reserves it needs to survive what could be a fraught winter.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='The residential area of Kyiv hit by four missile strikes on Sunday was also targeted in April, as the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, visited the city. This time – after weeks during which the capital had not been attacked – Vladimir Putin doubtless aimed to fire a warning to G7 leaders gathering in Bavaria, and before a Nato summit in Madrid this week. A seven-year-old girl pulled injured from the rubble was among those who paid the price for Mr Putin’s brutal piece of symbolism. Calculated outrages such as this, and Monday’s strike on a busy shopping centre in central Ukraine, must be met with unity and renewed focus from the west. This is an ominous moment in the war. The Kremlin’s strategic refocusing of its ambitions on the eastern Donbas is now leading to significant Russian territory gains in the region. Mr Putin’s cynical blockade of the Black Sea port of Odesa is, meanwhile, driving food prices up in developing nations, creating a hunger crisis which risks being associated with western sanctions on Moscow. In the west, the politics of the cost of living crisis – in part a consequence of the war – is destabilising governments and leaders who have presented a united front since February’s invasion. Understandably, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, fears that global repugnance at Russia’s actions since February may morph into wearied resignation and acceptance of a fait accompli in the east. The Kremlin’s evolving long game must not be permitted to succeed. As Moscow’s aggression exacts a fearful toll on the Ukrainian population and on the country’s military forces, western leaders must seek ways to intensify the pressure on Mr Putin while continuing to ensure that Nato is not dragged directly into the war. In Bavaria, unveiling a new support package for Ukraine, G7 leaders struck the right note, pledging “financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support” for “as long as it takes”. Turning that rhetoric into effective action will be far from easy. Most urgently, there must be swift delivery of the defensive military assistance Ukraine desperately needs, particularly the modern air defence systems Mr Zelenskiy requested in his meeting with G7 leaders. But as Mr Putin’s regime continues to benefit from the rocketing global price of energy – compromising the effect of western sanctions – new forms of economic pressure and tactics are also needed. A suite of new measures announced in Bavaria, including higher tariffs on Russian goods, is welcome. More significant may be an emerging consensus in favour of a global cap on the price of Russian oil and gas. Such a cap would both starve the Kremlin of funding and reduce inflationary pressures on importers. Pipeline logistics would make it difficult for Moscow to find alternative gas markets in the short term. That, at least, is the optimistic scenario. But for a worldwide price ceiling to work effectively, greater buy-in from other countries around the world will be needed. This will not be straightforward. India, for instance, has ramped up imports of Russian oil since the invasion. In developing countries, an information war needs to be fought against Mr Putin’s disingenuous attempts to weaponise the Black Sea blockade. Concrete economic assistance should be delivered to these regions. To win hearts and minds for Ukraine, the west needs to show its solidarity and goodwill does not run out at the borders of Europe.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='And it is the brainchild of Washington academics. Advocates are, however, touting slightly different but not necessarily conflicting versions of the idea. Yellen principally wants to impose a cap on the price of seaborne oil, which will disproportionately affect Russia. Draghi thinks it is possible to go further by putting a cap on piped Russian gas. In some ways, his idea has greater potential since European consumption is not due to trail off as quickly. Francesco Giavazzi, the economic adviser to the Italian prime minister, explained Draghi’s plan to the Guardian. He said: “Russia’s gas pipelines essentially go in two directions: to Europe and – for the moment with much smaller capacity – to China. A gas producer can slow the flow of gas, but it cannot stop it. Ultimately, if there is no flow, one will have to start burning gas in the air – which means burning dollars in the air. Putin could do it, but it would be very expensive for Russia, also politically.” Draghi, who tends to get a hearing at summits on economic issues, explained: “We must reduce the amount of money going to Russia and get rid of one of the main causes of inflation.” The oil cap would in theory work through one lever – insurance. Nearly 95% of the world’s oil tanker fleet is covered by the International Group of Protection & Indemnity Clubs in the heart of the City of London, and some firms based in continental Europe. European nations already agreed to end insurance for Russian oil shipments. Western governments could try to impose a price cap by telling buyers their insurance is available, but only as long as they agree not to pay more than a certain price for the oil onboard. In the papers that have been circulating at the G7, no figure is mentioned. It was clearly a battle at the G7 for the US to get Germany to engage with this idea, and they ended up with a classic summit compromise to allow technical experts to go away and study the idea. There are multiple drawbacks to the oil plan. First, it is possible the insurers will say they are being deprived of legitimate business for no valid reason. Second, the EU might have to reopen painfully agreed existing oil sanctions packages to endorse the idea. That would require unanimity, and Hungary might again block progress in favour of cheaper oil. The EU is also due to phase out oil purchases by the end of the year. Third, Putin might say, if he is being required to sell the oil at marginal costs, that he will simply not sell. He has shown with gas he is prepared to forgo some revenue by slowing or turning off the taps to intimidate gas-dependent countries such as Germany and Moldova. It might not be an economically rational response by Putin, but the Kremlin is not currently seen as a paragon of reason.\\nFinally, and most importantly, is the question of whether oil-importing countries such as India that are less engaged in the war be willing to go along with the scheme. At one level they would have no choice if they had no shipping insurance. But India might also be positively disposed to the idea of getting an expensive commodity at a cheaper price. The pricing would be a matter of fine-tuning. Oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia might also not welcome this piece of novel market manipulation fearing that if this worked it sets a precedent that puts oil-consuming nations in the driving seat. Mark Mozur, a market analyst for S&P Global Commodity Insights, says “the battle has already been lost, for this year at least” as Russia has reported high revenues.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='Vladimir Putin and Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom appear to be turning the screw on Europe by limiting gas supplies. The head of the International Energy Agency has now warned that Europe needs to prepare immediately for the eventuality of Russia turning off all gas exports to the region this winter. The invasion of Ukraine has triggered a scramble by countries to wean themselves off energy imports from Russia, but fresh urgency has been injected into those efforts. What’s happening? Russia has begun cutting off countries from supplies in an apparent move to hinder their efforts to fill their gas storage before the winter. Over the past week, Gazprom has cut supplies running through Europe’s major natural gas pipeline, Nord Stream 1, by 60%. This has triggered supply cuts in Italy, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Gas has also been shut off to a string of other countries including Poland, Bulgaria, France and the Netherlands. An explosion at a huge Freeport liquified natural gas (LNG) facility in the Texas Gulf Coast – which shipped gas to Europe – has also squeezed supplies. Can Europe replace Russian gas by the winter? No chance. Before the war, Russia supplied 40% of Europe’s gas supplies, so limitations on storing gas or ramping up imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in certain countries including Germany make replacing Russian gas entirely near impossible in the short term. EU leaders have downplayed the likelihood of a total ban on Russian gas as it is seen as impractical and politically divisive. Instead, nations are racing to fill up their storage caverns earlier in the year than usual. Europe’s underground storage caverns are 57% currently full. The European Commission has asked each country to reach 80% storage by the start of November, with Germany targeting 90% by the same point. However, without Russian gas, these targets will be hard to meet. “The only way they’ll get near the target is by paying very high prices. The US is sending LNG to Europe over Asia because countries in Europe are paying more,” said Investec oil and gas analyst Nathan Piper. Where can European countries turn? European governments are increasingly turning to the US to supply greater volumes of expensive LNG. The UK could capitalise on the crisis by ramping up natural gas exports to the EU further via interconnectors. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that goods exports to the EU rose for the third consecutive month to £16.4bn in April, the highest monthly level in current prices since comparable records began in 1997, driven by gas and crude oil shipped to the Netherlands and Ireland. European governments are also attempting to get more piped gas from Norway and Azerbaijan and ramp up the use of renewable energy. Meanwhile, Asian countries, such as Pakistan, are increasingly having to turn back to heavily polluting coal as Europe snaps up all the gas. What happens if they can’t replace it? The most likely outcome will be that businesses will scale back on energy use. In Germany, which gets 35% of its gas imports from Russia, energy-intensive industries such as steelmaking will face a squeeze and limits on production. “Either governments will impose limits on energy usage, or prices will become so high that it will become uneconomic to use,” said Piper. “There could be a pinch point if Russia cuts off gas flows this winter when usage is high. Even during the cold war, Russia was a reliable energy supplier. Now that link has been cut.”\\nCould Russia’s cutoffs affect the UK? The UK imported just 4% of its gas needs from Russia last year and appears to be fairly well insulated from the supply issues.', type='text')]\n",

      "[Content(text='The huge blue and red hull of the SCF Primorye came into port at Vadinar, western Gujarat, India, earlier this month. The 84,000-tonne oil tanker, built in 2009 and sailing under the Liberian flag, had arrived from the port at Ust-Luga, a settlement in Russia near the border with Estonia. Until 2017, the Vadinar oil refinery was controlled by Essar – the Indian owner of the Stanlow refinery in Ellesmere Port. Since then a consortium including the sanctioned Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft and the commodities trader Trafigura, which holds a 24.5% stake, have owned Nayara Energy, which runs the refinery. The tanker’s arrival came as India ramped up imports of Russian oil. The Asian nation’s willingness to snap up Russian crude at discounts of up to 30% has undermined efforts from the US, Europe and the UK to deplete Vladimir Putin’s war coffers by curtailing imports. Russia raked in $20bn from oil exports in May, bouncing back to pre-invasion levels. Now, concerns are growing that India is being used as a potential back door into Europe for Russian oil supplies,given the surge in imports. Before the invasion of Ukraine, India’s imports of Russian oil were negligible due to high freight costs. But recently, imports of Russian oil to India have increased. Vadinar’s owner, Nayara, purchased Russian oil in March – just before international restrictions on its exports were introduced – after a gap of a year, buying about 1.8m barrels from Trafigura, Reuters reported.\\nThe volumes that India has been buying and exporting, however, suggest that some of the refined Russian crude may ultimately be used in Europe’s filling stations. It is not clear where the Russian crude brought into Vadinar on the SCF Primorye will be used. Vadinar’s owner’s declined to comment on the shipment or whether it was shipping Russian oil to Europe. In May, India imported about 800,000 barrels of oil per day from Russia and the rating agency Fitch predicts that imports could soon increase further to 1m barrels per day, or 20% of India’s total imports. India, China and the United Arab Emirates have picked up the slack as Russian crude oil imports into the EU fell by 18% in May. Putin told the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) business summit this week that “Russian oil supplies to China and India are growing noticeably”. India’s 1.4 billion-strong population gives it reason to seek cheap supplies. But it’s a dangerous political game. “India is walking a tightrope,” said Alan Gelder, the vice-president of refining, chemicals and oil markets at Wood Mackenzie. “If you take too much, you do not want the west to sanction the rest of your economy.” The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air said Reliance Industries’ Jamnagar refinery in Gujarat received 27% of its oil from Russia in May, up from 5% in April. The centre said about 20% of exported cargoes from Jamnagar left for the Suez canal, indicating that they were heading to Europe or the US. Shipments were made to France, Italy and the UK. However, there is no evidence that these shipments included Russian oil. The UK has committed to phasing out Russian oil by the end of the year. Britain did not import any petrol before the war but diesel accounted for 18% of total demand. Trading in Russian oil remains legal.', type='text')]\n",

That’s not true,” Scholz told Germany’s ZDF television. “There are democracies all over the world and they have very similar perspectives,” added Scholz, who is hosting this week’s summit of the smaller Group of Seven industrial powers. In an attempt to prevent the G7 from being seen as a rich man’s club obsessed only with a war in Europe, Scholz had invited five counterparts from South Africa, India, Argentina, Senegal and Indonesia to join the discussion on world hunger, development and the environment. However, his appeal was weakened by the fact that only 90 minutes were set aside at the summit to discuss food, health and climate. Discussion of debt or the injection of new Special Drawing Rights funds, two issues of central concern to Africa, were absent, now largely seen as issues to be discussed by the wider G20 later this year. Green groups also complained that climate crisis commitments in the draft G7 communique risked being watered down, especially the passages on ending public sector investment in gas, and a commitment to zero-emission vehicles. None of the visiting leaders has been enthusiastic about the war in Ukraine, and especially not for its effect on their economies, already battered by Covid and the climate crisis. Three of them abstained from voting on a UN security council resolution condemning Russia’s invasion. The president of Senegal, Macky Sall, as chair of the Africa Union, has warned that the poorest countries are “caught between the hammer of war and the anvil of sanctions”. The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, the current chair of the G20, has advocated a ceasefire and offered himself as a mediator in the conflict. Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa, has avoided criticism of Vladimir Putin, taking aim instead at the west for not adhering to “the principles of solidarity and cooperation when it comes to equitable access to vaccines”. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has frustrated the west by buying Russian oil at discount prices and suddenly imposing a ban on wheat exports. The fifth guest, Alberto Angel Fernández, the president of Argentina, the world’s sixth largest wheat exporter facing 60% inflation, has also increased levies on food exports. None of them seemed taken by Scholz’s argument of a war between democrats and autocrats. One of the problems is a weariness in Africa about the G7’s failure to deliver on pledges made in long-forgotten G7 communiques. The last time G7 leaders met in 2015, they pledged “to lift 500 million people in developing countries out of hunger and malnutrition by 2030”. Oxfam pointed out: “When the goals were set in 2015, there were 630 million in hunger. As of 2021, this figure is thought to be 950 million.” In the critical diplomacy over the food crisis, the west has belatedly gone on the offensive by insisting that it is Putin, and not western sanctions, that is responsible for the collapse in grain exports and spiralling prices. But Russia has released counter-propaganda claiming its food exports are hampered by EU sanctions, something Brussels denies. The complex negotiations on reaching an agreement on safe passage for grain convoys, overseen by Turkey and the UN, have lasted a month, and some countries on the brink of starvation want a solution.', type='text')]\n",
