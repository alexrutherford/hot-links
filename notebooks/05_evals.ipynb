      " Giles Clarke, the England and Wales Cricket Board president, will be summoned to answer questions by the Commons culture, media and sport select committee over his role in the controversial “Big Three” takeover of the International Cricket Council. Clarke, the former ECB chairman, was central to the reforms in early 2014 that led to India, England and Australia taking greater control of cricket’s governing body and allocating themselves 52% of revenues generated by international events. With the select committee having spoken to Greg Dyke, the FA chairman, over Fifa corruption, the athletics chief Sebastian Coe regarding doping and Chris Kermode of the ATP on the subject of match-fixing in tennis, it will now turn its attention to cricket’s governance.\n",
      "“The committee has decided to look into the conduct of the ECB in relation to the governance of international cricket, in the context of the other investigations it is undertaking,” a spokesperson said. “The committee has already looked at football, athletics and tennis, as part of a wider group of investigations into sports governance and, in relation to cricket, the ECB is an obvious choice to call in.” Damian Collins, the Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe who sits on the select committee, has also emailed the ECB chairman, Colin Graves, about the ICC issue, having been part of a protest outside The Oval by the Change Cricket campaign last summer. Shashank Manohar, the new ICC chairman, has already vowed to review the 2014 restructure before the annual conference in June, with Collins now asking Graves how he and the ECB envisage change. “This is a crucial moment for cricket,” Collins said. “We have put six key questions to the ECB, because the cricketing public deserve to know how their game is being run. “England, along with India and Australia, are the most influential boards at the ICC. In August I accused them of orchestrating a back-room power grab that saw these three countries taking over the game at the expense of the other 102. “We welcome the news from the recent ICC board meeting that the ICC is considering governance reform but we want to know what the ECB thinks that reform should look like. “It is hugely important that cricket does not miss this opportunity to embrace meaningful reform, and that the ECB are at the forefront of ensuring that the international game gets the independent, transparent and accountable governance it deserves. And if the ECB disagrees, we need to know why.” Collins’ email to Graves was sent last week before a special screening of Death of a Gentleman at the House of Commons on Monday night, the award-winning documentary by filmmakers Sam Collins and Jarrod Kimber that charts the so-called “Big Three” takeover of the ICC. “The England & Wales Cricket Board is aware of interest from the Select Committee for Culture, Media & Sport to look into the governance of international cricket,” an ECB spokesman said. “The Committee has already spoken to a number of sports bodies in their on-going enquiries into the governance of international sport and we would welcome the opportunity to talk with them in the coming weeks.”\n",

      " The embattled IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, has been warned he must show more humility over the doping scandal which has engulfed athletics before his appearance at the House of Commons on Wednesday.Lord Coe will be questioned by MPs from the culture, media and sport select committee over the investigation into blood doping in the sport following revelations made in the Sunday Times in August.“There needs to be more humility from the IAAF and he needs to recognise that there have clearly been problems with the way doping issues have been dealt with in the past,” the committee member Damian Collins told The Times.Sebastian Coe must feel his dream IAAF job is already turning into a nightmareRead more“I thought the way the IAAF rubbished the Sunday Times investigation was totally inappropriate. Their response has been incredibly aggressive.”Collins added that he hoped athletics would now follow cycling’s lead and set up an independent body to manage doping.Coe will be asked about the world governing body’s response to doping allegations, including the former Olympic 1,500m champion’s remark in August that investigations into suspicious blood results amounted to “a declaration of war on our sport”.He has since insisted he was only referring to stories which had tainted the reputation of clean athletes. Coe can also expect questions on his association with Nike and Collins acknowledged that he had “done the right thing” in ending his 37-year association with the American sportswear company.However, the MP for Folkestone & Hythe admitted that Coe will face questions over the controversial decision to award the 2021 world championships to Eugene.“There are serious questions about the general process by which Eugene was awarded the world championships,” he said. “It was a very unusual process. Why did it take place?”\n"
