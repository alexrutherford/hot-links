On the final weekend before the Iowa caucuses, the presidential candidates straggling behind the leaders – Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio for the Republicans, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the Democrats – carried on with brave faces, despite sinking poll numbers and ambivalent voters. Underdog candidates could, however, have an outsize effect on the campaign: their supporters represent the spread between the leaders. Sway voters who prefer a third- (or fourth- or fifth-) tier contender could bring another candidate closer to the nomination. For example supporters of the third Democratic candidate, Martin O’Malley, polling at 3% in Iowa could ultimately sway the race on Monday. According to caucus rules, a candidate must have support from 15% of caucus-goers in any given precinct to reach “viability”. If too few voters support a candidate, they are free to support another. Both the Clinton and Sanders camps have sought to win over O’Malley backers. Nonetheless, on Saturday in Boone, Iowa, the former governor of Maryland told supporters not to waver. “Hold strong in that first alignment,” he said. “We have to beat expectations. I’m hoping and working to make my campaign the surprise that comes out of Iowa.”
Touring the state he won eight years ago, meanwhile, Republican Mike Huckabee projected the aura of a tired heritage act as he spoke to Iowans in small-town clubs and bars. One part preacher to two parts standup guy, the former Arkansas governor charmed the room at the Inspired Grounds coffee shop in West Des Moines. But after visiting all 99 counties these past eight months, he is nowhere in the polls. “I’m going to be glad,” he told the gathering, “when we finally actually base this whole election on votes rather than some east coast pollster who has never spent a night in Iowa, and doesn’t have a clue about voters who are going to be going to the caucuses.” In the age of Instagram and viral videos, Huckabee spoke up for “the old-fashioned way” of electioneering. “Hard work and handshakes”, he said are the real way to pass your audition for a job at the White House. There was no policy pitch, except for a moment to hymn the value of lawmaking experience and warn of the danger of appointing as president another untried freshman senator – a swipe at Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul. Outside, Gary Leffler, a resident and Huckabee supporter, said the former governor is “a man of faith, a man of God”, and that “you have to vote on principle and I’m a principled man”. Asked about the long odds of his preferred candidate, Leffler said he would at least vote Republican no matter what. Huckabee’s rival Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon whose support in the state peaked at 25% but has now dropped to 10%, pledged to voters that he would defy the odds.
“We’re seeing a lot of movement on the ground, there’s a lot of shifting going on right now,” Carson told the Detroit News on Friday, in south-east Iowa. “It almost feels like an earthquake. And I think a lot of it is shifting in our favor. So we’re actually looking forward to a very good night, which would be quite surprising, I think, to a lot of pundits.” Another one-time frontrunner, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, has seen his numbers steadily decline to the point that he found 2% support in the Register poll – neck-and-neck with “undecided”. In recent days Bush has traveled with his wife Columba and daughter Noelle. Next month, they will be joined in New Hampshire by their four grandchildren and former president George W Bush.
In Sioux City, he told reporters: “This is a family deal, especially when you get to the beginning of the end.” Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, made the rounds in Iowa, with a stop at the Chrome Horse Saloon in Cedar Rapids. “When you see me in a place like this,” he told the crowd, “I become smarter and more charming and better looking and funny. By the time you walk out of here, you are going to be, ‘Damn, man, that guy should be emperor.’” Christie, the Financial Times reported, cautioned the crowd against supporting Trump, the Republican frontrunner. “Showtime is over,” he said. “We are not electing the entertainer-in-chief, everybody … we are electing the commander-in-chief. This isn’t a game. This isn’t a TV show. This is the real world.” Carly Fiorina, too, has walked a long road in Iowa, pushing her program to “take our government back”. In Mason City, USA Today reported, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO tried to explain her concept of zero-based budgeting. “It means you can examine any dollar, you can cut any dollar and you can move any dollar. All the government does now is discuss the rate of increase.” Senator Rand Paul, too, predicted he will surprise in Monday’s caucus, arguing that polls are skewed toward older voters, not the younger voters who rally to his pro-liberty positions. He told NBC on Sunday that his campaign has called “a million” Iowans: “I think we’ve called them so much we know them by name by now.”
And Ohio governor John Kasich, recently endorsed by the New York Times as their editorial board’s Republican of choice, gave up on Iowa almost completely. He campaigned in New Hampshire, accompanied by a guitarist, and said he was “thrilled” by the newspaper’s endorsement. “It really illustrates for a lot of people that Kasich’s a conservative but he has wide appeal,” Kasich told reporters. “He can get people to come who traditionally don’t go. And the last guy I can think of who could do that is Ronald Reagan.” Lauren Gambino contributed to this report.",2016-01-31T23:53:37Z,1
us-news/2016/jan/31/iowa-caucus-worlds-most-patriotic-tractor-mike-huckabee,US news,Iowa caucus: hologram eagle and Jesus star on America's most patriotic tractor,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/31/iowa-caucus-worlds-most-patriotic-tractor-mike-huckabee,"In Des Moines on Sunday, the Guardian was given a tour of the world’s most patriotic tractor.
The 1957 860 Ford, complete with hologram eagle whose eyes follow passersby, the names of military veterans and “Jesus in the clouds”, is the creation of Gary Leffler of West Des Moines. As Monday’s Iowa caucus approached, Leffler was sticking to his support for former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, an underdog in this race but a politician with a strong evangelical following who won the state in 2008. “Underneath the hood of the tractor is all the names of our family that served in the military,” Leffler said as he conducted a tour of the vehicle, noting that his son had just been promoted to captain and would thus need to have his title on the tractor updated. The top of the hood features a Bible verse, John 3:16, and a cross, Leffler said, “and if you look in the clouds right here you can see Jesus in the clouds.” “It’s all airbrushed in,” said Leffler, who did not paint the tractor himself.
Continuing the tour, he added: “My wife says, ‘Really? You put a snake on the tractor?’ I said that’s for Isis, al-Qaida and the Taliban.” Leffler’s tractor also features pictures of wolves – because “I just like ‘em,” he said – and an Iowa buck, of which as a “big-time deer hunter” he shoots “two or three” a year. Asked about his support for Huckabee, given his parlous position in the polls, Leffler said: “Doesn’t matter. “I’m a principled man, and that’s the reason I’m going for Mike Huckabee. No1 his stand on guns: perfect. His stand on pro-life: perfect. He’s the only man who can stand up and say, ‘I’ve beaten the Clinton machine.’ Thirdly, as Ronald Reagan said, our best presidents have come from the governors program. “When you add it all up, he’s a man of God and when you look at the credentials of what he can do, I have to go with Mike Huckabee. To me it’s not even a choice, it’s just clear-cut.” Leffler also said that if Huckabee is not the Republican presidential nominee, he would be “100% for whoever the Republican nominee will be”. “There’s a lot of things Donald Trump does that I like,” he said.",2016-01-31T23:46:28Z,2
world/2016/jan/31/tanzania-britsh-helicopter-pilot-roger-gower-shot-down-three-men-arrested,World news,British pilot in Tanzania 'manoeuvred ​to save colleague​​ before death',https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/31/tanzania-britsh-helicopter-pilot-roger-gower-shot-down-three-men-arrested,"A British pilot who was shot dead by an elephant poaching gang manoeuvred his helicopter to save his colleague’s life before he collapsed and died, according to reports. Roger Gower died while tracking poachers in the Maswa game reserve in the north of the country. Officials said his helicopter crashed after being hit by rounds from an AK-47 rifle fired from the ground on Friday. Gower, 37, and a safari guide, Nicky Bester, were flying low to the ground searching for gunmen who had killed three elephants in the reserve when the gang broke cover and shot at them from the ground with the automatic rifle. A bullet is understood to have passed through the floor of the helicopter, hitting Gower first in the leg then in the shoulder before exiting through the roof. Despite his injuries Gower managed to fly the helicopter down into a tree preventing a potential explosion and saving Bester, who jumped to safety as the aircraft came down and hid from the poachers in a thicket, wildlife authorities said. Photographs of the crashed helicopter showed apparent bullet holes in the fuselage. A spokesman from Tanzania National Parks, Pascal Shelutete, said: “Three elephant carcasses that were found indicated that whoever shot the chopper down was on a serious illegal hunting spree.” He added that poachers can be “heavily armed with sophisticated military weaponry”. Three men have been arrested by Tanzanian police. The natural resources and tourism minister, Jumanne Maghembe, said: “The suspects are in the hands of police. They are cooperating, and soon more people making up the poaching gang will be netted and brought to justice.” The mission had been a collaboration between the Friedkin Conservation Fund and the Tanzanian government, which has struggled to respond to an explosion of “industrial-scale poaching” in recent years. Dan Friedkin, the chairman of the Friedkin Conservation Fund, said Gower had been engaged in a joint mission with Tanzanian officials to catch elephant poachers. He said: “Roger was killed while piloting a helicopter during a coordinated effort with the Tanzanian wildlife authorities to track down and arrest active elephant poachers. In the course of this action, the poachers fired upon the helicopter and Roger was fatally wounded.” Pratik Patel, a close friend working on the same anti-poaching operation, told BBC Radio 5: “They did see ... two [elephant] carcasses. While he was looking for the poachers, he heard gunshots and moved to the area and saw a fresh carcass, the third elephant that had just gone down within 24 hours. “I guess the poachers heard the helicopters searching and tried to make away with the ivory and hide. When Roger came across the carcasses, he hovered over them and moved forward to search the area. What he saw was evidence of ivory and turned the helicopter to come back to the spot. “At that point, one of the poachers sneaked out of the bushes and shot Roger, forcing the helicopter to hit the ground really hard. The bullet that hit Roger cut through the floor of the helicopter, through his leg, part of his body and shoulder and hit his face, before going through the roof of the helicopter. It was from a heavy calibre gun – probably the same gun that they used to kill the elephant.” He paid tribute to “a great guy, a great friend, a great pilot” who he said loved working with Tanzania’s wildlife: “Roger was an amazing person, an amazing character, full of joy, full of life. He loved Africa, he loved Tanzania and he loved being in the bush.” Andy Payne, Gower’s colleague and housemate, described him as a “respected and professional pilot” who was becoming increasingly invested in working to stop the “wanton killing” of Tanzania’s elephants. Gower and Bester had been sent to track the poachers after reports came in about shots heard in the bush about 12 miles (19km) from their base. Payne told the Telegraph: “Roger was injured but thankfully he was flying low and slow and under the circumstances, he did a fantastic job of putting the helicopter down in a way that his colleague was able to walk away with minor injuries. It was a hard landing but he managed to roll it on to its side.” Although the aircraft was deep in the bush, Bester had a satellite phone, a radio and GPS and was able to call for help and was taken to hospital. Gower could not be saved. Payne said Gower had always been safety-conscious. “He always erred on the side of caution, would pay attention to aviation accident reports and we would discuss them to ensure we would never fall into those traps,” he said. Payne added that he, Gower and Bester shared a house near their base in Arusha. He said Bester was “obviously very shaken up but recovering well physically”. “He has some non-life threatening injuries from the heavy landing but it could have been much worse,” he said. “He and Roger worked together a lot, all three of us have been friends from before Roger joined us last year but it was the first time we’d all worked together and it was great.” Meanwhile Lazaro Nyalandu, a former minister of tourism and natural resources, wrote on Twitter that Gower was killed by AK-47 assault rifle fire. Paying tribute, he tweeted: “You loved our country and I knew you on many flights we took together in defence of our wildlife heritage. Life is precious. “Those poachers who killed Capt Roger are coward, evil, and sad people. A fine hearted individual gone too soon, and our hearts are broken. Capt Roger’s body was flown into Arusha early today, as those who killed him are still at large. Everything must [be] done to bring them to justice.” The Foreign Office confirmed it is providing support to the victim’s family. Gower trained as an accountant in London and became a helicopter pilot in 2004. Before working in Tanzania, he flew from neighbouring Kenya, working for safaris and excursions. He was understood to have attended the prestigious Hallfield independent school in Edgbaston, while his family had ties to Edgbaston Golf Club. Gower was reportedly the youngest son of David Gower, a former partner of Birmingham-based law firm Pinsents. His parents were due to arrive in Tanzania this weekend to meet his colleagues and find out more from police about what happened. Meanwhile his friends and family posted tributes on social media using the hashtag #flyhighcaptainroger. Jo South, Gower’s cousin, wrote: “My amazing cousin, forever in our hearts. So very proud. In memory of my cousin who was tragically killed by poachers please help me spread the word and put an end to this.” Sandra Velarde, an ecologist working in the region, wrote: “Sad. Roger Gowler was murdered by poachers in Tanzania. Your cheekiness will be missed.” A census in June found that the elephant population in Tanzania, which depends heavily on the safari tourism industry, declined from 110,000 in 2009 to about 43,000 in 2014. Demand for ivory from fast-growing Asian economies such as China and Vietnam, where it is turned into jewellery and ornaments, has led to a rise in poaching across sub-Saharan Africa. Tanzanian authorities said they had made progress over the past few months in their crackdown on illegal poaching. Last October, charges were brought against a prominent Chinese businesswoman, Yang Feng Glan, 66, who was dubbed the “Ivory Queen” for running a network that smuggled out hundreds of tusks. Gower’s brother Max has set up a fundraising page in the pilot’s memory with the aim of raising £50,000 for anti-poaching efforts in Tanzania. “Some good should come out of Roger’s tragic death,” he wrote on the JustGiving site.

football/2016/jan/31/late-winner-gets-usa-off-to-winning-start-in-2016-against-iceland,Football,USA 3-2 Iceland | International friendly match report,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/31/late-winner-gets-usa-off-to-winning-start-in-2016-against-iceland,"USA took a step toward shaking off the ghosts of 2015 with an aggressive effort in rainy Carson, California, on Sunday to equalize twice and eventually edge out Iceland, 3-2. It was the late heroics from defender Steve Birnbaum in his second USA appearance that kept a sloppy defensive team performance from overshadowing a strong attacking effort. He nabbed the equalizing assist and game-winning goal, both on set pieces. In the 90th minute, Birnbaum rose to connect with a Michael Bradley set piece, to head past goalkeeper Ögmundur Kristinsson. Centre-back Michael Oroczo pulled the US level for a second time in the 59th minute, finishing a header from Birnbaum off a Bradley corner. Iceland were missing key personnel in attack, but still made the US pay dearly for defensive mistakes. Debutant Aron Sigurðarson scored Iceland’s second goal from a long-range, curling strike in the 66th minute after the American defense was caught off-guard. USA coach Jürgen Klinsmann yet again experimented with a new defensive four, which had a rocky start, leading to an early Iceland goal in front of a sparse crowd at the StubHub Center. A weak clearance in the 12th minute landed at the feet of Kristinn Steindórsson, whose deflected shot left goalkeeper Luis Robles with no chance to save. Orozco was a late addition to the US training camp, with Klinsmann calling him in Friday after the squad had been training together for two and a half weeks.
As shaky as the USA defense looked when tested, the attack was strong, holding possession and out-shooting Iceland 16 to six. Jozy Altidore pulled USA level for the first time in the 20th minute after a nice sequence that started with Jermaine Jones in the Americans’ own half. Jones passed upfield to Gyasi Zardes, whose first time ball to Bradley was slipped into Altidore for a chip finish. “It’s the first game of the year – we’re trying to get our legs under us still,” Altidore said. “We’re working really hard in training and it’s nice to play against a real opponent and gets a few minutes.” “We have to get fitter, but that’s normal this time of the year,” he added. “We just need to be a little bit sharper. Sometimes that final pass wasn’t there, that first touch wasn’t there, but it will come in due time.” Though Sunday’s affair was only a friendly, Klinsmann will be keen to put a rough 2015 behind him. The US crashed out of the Concacaf Gold Cup for their worst finish since 2000 and then lost a playoff against Mexico for a berth in next year’s Confederations Cup. The under-23 squad failed to guarantee a spot in this summer’s Olympics after losing to Honduras in the semi-final of the Concacaf qualifying tournament, a competition Klinsmann named as a top priority for last year. Klinsmann took a different tact with his January camp leading up to Sunday’s match by calling in a mix of senior team and under-23 players that will face Colombia in a last-chance play-off for berth into the Rio Olympics. The senior squad, meanwhile, has 2018 World Cup qualifying and Copa America on the calendar later this year. Iceland represented a strong first opponent of 2016 for the US, having recently qualified for Euro 2016, the smallest country ever to qualify for the tournament. But key absences in Sunday’s starting line-up included strikers Gylfi Sigurðsson, Alfreð Finnbogason and Kolbeinn Sigþórsson. Sunday was the first meeting between Iceland and the US since 1994, having previously gone 2-2-2 in six matches. Klinsmann’s line-up showed an eye to the future as he handed out first caps while continuing to start a mix of veteran players like 34-year-old Jermaine Jones. Both Ethan Finlay and Kellyn Acosta earned their first caps for the senior team and Lee Nguyen earned his first start after seven previous caps. Cameroonian-American Tony Tchani and German-American Jerome Kiesewetter both made their US senior debuts as a second-half substitutes. The US will return to the StubHub Center for another friendly on Friday against Canada. Qualifying for the 2018 World Cup resumes in March against Guatemala.",2016-01-31T23:30:49Z,4
football/2016/jan/31/blackburn-paul-lambert-oxford-fa-cup,Football,Reinvigorated Paul Lambert reflects after improved Blackburn display,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/31/blackburn-paul-lambert-oxford-fa-cup,"The clean-shaven, spectacle free and suspiciously jocular Paul Lambert who faced the press after Blackburn’s win over Oxford United could scarcely have been further removed from the dour, defensive and irritable version of the Scot who left Aston Villa 12 months ago. So much so, he was asked if he had made a conscious decision to reinvent himself during his nine-month break from the game that does not appear to have been much of a break at all.
“I loved my time off, I really did,” he said. “I did things I wanted to do – I was with Bayer Leverkusen, I was with Real Madrid, I was with Bayern Munich, I was with Dortmund … I was everywhere. I loved watching the training, it was great meeting different people and enjoying my life. I knew the job I’d done at Aston Villa, I knew the money I’d got [to spend] there was nowhere near what they’re getting now. Was I happy? Aye, absolutely, but I knew [the sack] was coming and I was happy because everyone can see now it’s just a little bit harder there than people think.” What passes for Lambert’s new-found joie de vivre was reflected in the Blackburn Rovers team he took over in mid-November as they set about dismantling an Oxford team who had beaten Premier League Swansea in the previous round. Rock solid in defence against a team two divisions beneath them, Rovers have had a torrid time in the Championship but tore into their hosts from the outset and all but settled the tie by the interval through a Ben Marshall penalty for a Joe Skarz foul on the always lively Simeon Jackson, followed by a fine 21-yard diagonal drive from their new striker Tony Watt, in for Jordan Rhodes. A pearler of a free-kick from Marshall ended Oxford’s resistance. Michael Appleton admitted they had “been a little bit naive”, unable to deal with Blackburn’s high press and physical approach, which would have pleased Lambert if he had been able to see it. Asked if his new look, sans glasses, had been achieved as a result of laser surgery or contact lenses, he confessed it is down to little more than vanity. “No,” he laughed. “I still cannae see.” Man of the match Ben Marshall (Blackburn)",2016-01-31T22:30:10Z,5
football/blog/2016/jan/31/leyton-orient-cambridge-kevin-nolan,Football,Leyton Orient’s Kevin Nolan admits to hurt after Cambridge defeat | Jeremy Alexander,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jan/31/leyton-orient-cambridge-kevin-nolan,"Reality caught up with Kevin Nolan on Saturday. Appointed by Leyton Orient as player-manager nine days previously, he had supervised two wins. Just as significant were two clean sheets. Orient had managed only one in 21 League Two games and gone 11 without one. Now they reverted to type and lost 3-1 at home to Cambridge United. “If it had been the first game, I could have taken it on the chin,” Nolan said. “It hurt a bit more after the last two performances.” At least the six points took Orient to sixth. Nine would have put them fifth. As it is, the O’s are ninth, only two places and two points above the U’s. There is time for both new managers to make their mark. Shaun Derry, succeeding Richard Money in mid-November, has already taken his side from 18th. “The potential here has got legs,” he said when he arrived. They hardly needed legs here. Open arms were sufficient. On Friday Brian Corr, their leading scorer with 12, was ruled out for the season with a knee injury but Ben Williamson stepped up to the plate which Orient held out to him. Nolan said beforehand: “It’s all about keeping our feet on the ground.” But their heads were in the clouds. Frazer Shaw’s soft back-pass let in Williamson early on, who then bullied the ball off Connor Essam after the interval for the second. After Armand Gnanduillet came on and forced in a riposte, the left flank of defence was at once exposed again. This time Williamson squared the ball for Jimmy Spencer, also a substitute, to score with his first touch for Cambridge. Derry bought him on Friday from Notts County, where the manager started. Nolan, who fought many battles with Derry in Premier League midfields, referred to “the snowball effect of mistake after mistake”. The right side of defence held firm but the midfield, for all the energy of Nigel Atangana, gave the forwards nothing to work on. The wonder is that Jay Simpson has 22 goals, top of League Two by eight. Josh Coulson did a fine man-marking job.
Two seasons ago Orient finished third in League One under Russell Slade and the future looked fair. Then Barry Hearn, long-time owner, sold out to Francesco Becchetti, an Italian businessman. No doubt smarting at finding himself in baulk over the Olympic Stadium, Hearn warned: “If I was West Ham, I would be petrified of this fella.” He could not have done much worse if he had got Massimo Cellino, periodically allowed to be in charge at Leeds. Becchetti made his money in waste management and recycling. He has recycled five managers in 18 months. Nolan at 33 is sixth in line. On Boxing Day Becchetti, wanted by Albanian authorities to face charges (which he denies) of fraud-related offences and money laundering – nothing to do with clean sheets – kicked the assistant manager, Andy Hessenthaler up the backside after the match. Last week the Football Association fined him £40,000 and banned him from the club for six games. With these suspended pending appeal, Orient’s backroom largely stayed seated except for Nolan, who made his escape on to the field for the last quarter but too late to retrieve the game. Through Bolton, Newcastle and West Ham he was Sam Allardyce’s voice on the field as captain. After a first week which passed “at 100 miles an hour” he looks forward to preparing for Portsmouth on Saturday with more knowledge of his team. At least he looks fit for purpose, a potential inspiration off the field, an organiser on it.",2016-01-31T22:30:10Z,6
football/2016/jan/31/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-youngsters-fa-cup-west-ham,Football,Jürgen Klopp hails Liverpool youngsters but remains mindful of task in hand,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/31/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-youngsters-fa-cup-west-ham,"Jürgen Klopp’s exasperation was understandable. A replay against West Ham United ruined plans for a first full week of training since before Christmas and, should Liverpool triumph at Upton Park, the Capital One Cup final will bring February to a close after eight games in 27 days. January had nine in 29. And there is the small matter of a Merseyside derby to rearrange. Through the congestion, however, have sprung positives, and neither the Liverpool manager’s complaints nor a mundane goalless draw could disguise them at Anfield.
Cameron Brannagan, Brad Smith, Kevin Stewart and João Carlos Teixeira, aged 19, 21, 22 and 23 respectively, were instrumental in giving Liverpool the edge over Slaven Bilic’s disrupted and subdued team. Composed, mature, precise, their performances reflected well on Liverpool’s academy and are likely to be rewarded with further opportunity in next week’s replay. Klopp may have more options by then should his injury list reduce and Liverpool add to their ranks on deadline day. The club have not given up on another Teixeira, Alex, despite difficult talks with Shakhtar Donetsk, but their manager’s faith in young talent already at his disposal is being repaid. It would never have been tested without the demanding schedule that has generated such irritation. Klopp, somewhat reluctantly, said: “If we hadn’t had so many injuries and so many games then we wouldn’t have seen these guys, so that is a positive. We talk about us playing West Ham on a good run, and we’re talking about us missing chances, doing this better and that better, but because we have another game it feels less enjoyable. “But you need a special situation to see these young boys. I like working with them but I don’t usually have the time in the middle of these fixtures. They all came back from loan, Swindon, Wolves, Coventry, now they are all here – and we can work with them. We have a squad and we have to play the leader of the Premier League on Tuesday, then important games against Villa and Sunderland, so we should not use the young players in situations like this. Against West Ham, if they did anything wrong it’s my responsibility. They all did well and brilliant – that’s their responsibility. You can do it like this in the Cup but you can’t in the Premier League. The Premier League is the main tournament and you have to take everything you can get.” West Ham had a penalty appeal dismissed by the referee, Martin Atkinson, when the on-loan Liverpool defender Steven Caulker clearly handled inside his own area. Enner Valencia also missed a gilt-edged chance from Aaron Cresswell’s cross in the first half and the same source led to the substitute Michail Antonio hitting the post in the final minute, albeit the delivery was adjudged to have gone out of play. Makeshift Liverpool were the more cohesive, sharper team and the visitors needed a fine display from the goalkeeper Darren Randolph to preserve their hopes of beating the Anfield club for a third time this season. The Republic of Ireland international said: “We have had two decent results this season at Anfield. We have had two good performances from the team and I like coming here. It is never easy playing at Anfield and they have a good squad. It was always going to be tough regardless of who was playing and they have a point to prove if they are not getting much game time.” Man of the match Darren Randolph (West Ham United)",2016-01-31T22:30:10Z,7
